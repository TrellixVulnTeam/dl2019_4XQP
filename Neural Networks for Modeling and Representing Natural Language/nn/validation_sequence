"Damn," Damian breathed as he stared at the dark looking castle, taking in the haunting air around it. Beside him Dick blinked, looking at the towering stone building as well.

"Looks cool," Dick laughed and grunted when Damian absent-mindedly punched him in the stomach, still staring at the castle.

"First 'ears follow me!" a gruff voice bellowed, all the first years moving to the direction of the voice. Damian and Dick began to move only to be stopped by a man with greasy looking black hair and a sour expression on his pale skinned face.

"Damian Wayne and Dick Grayson, I'm assuming? I've been instructed to take you to the castle," the man stated with a tone that showed he wasn't happy with the situation. Damian looked him up and down, mentally listing all his openings and determining if he was a threat. Dick, seeing Damian on-guard, smiled and allowed the man to lead them away and to the castle.

Once inside the castle the man led them down a few dizzying corridors before bringing them to a large staircase, where a group of students were being herded by an aging woman. Damian didn't understand why they were lead separately but said nothing, watching as the man and the woman shared silent looks before casting their eyes over Dick, who was oblivious to their looks as he stared at the moving paintings. Damian held back the urge to face-palm, silently asking himself what his father was thinking by trusting Dick to watch over him.

"Once we go in you will wait for your name to be called before being sorted into your house," the aged woman spoke and opened the door, the sounds of chatter and laughter washing over the cluster of first years. Damian raised an eyebrow as they walked in, his eyes flying over the room.

Candles were hanging in the air, giving the Grand Hall a gothic theme. Dick absent-mindedly wondering if it worked outside the magic school – it'd make the Batcave look a lot more wicked. The ceiling was nonexistent as instead an image of a clear star-filled night showed when the children looked up. Dick nearly jumped out of his skin when the man from earlier placed a hand on his shoulder, signaling him to follow the older man. Dick waved goodbye to his protégé and followed the man, ignoring the stares and whispers of the students as he passed.

"When I call your name, please come up. Brooke Wombat," the woman spoke and Damian idly wondered what her name was.

"That's professor McGonagall," a female's mousy voice spoke from behind Damian. Damian turned, an eyebrow raised, to see a girl standing there, all smiles and sparkles. Damian's eyebrow twitched in annoyance.

"No one asked you," he grumbled out and the girl giggled.

"That's true, but your face said you wanted to know her name. I'm-!" The girl paused from introducing herself, taking a step back when Damian unleashed his mind version of his perfected Bat-glare.

"Don't know, don't care," he growled out and the pale girl rushed off to a group of girls, not once looking back at him. Those who were already seated and had been watching merely shook their heads. Children these days.

Damian leaned back on his left leg as he crossed his arms, bored. He glared at his robes, annoyed that he had to wear the same thing as every single person in the room. God, talk about crushing creativity. He zoned out, not even paying attention to the names being called. His eyes roamed the hall, taking in that people were staring at him. His eyes fell at the head of the hall, where a long table sat. Dick sat at the end of the table, staring directly at Damian. Dick, seeing as he caught Damian's attention, smiled widely. The boy's face scrunched up into one of disgust though if you were staring close enough, you'd have seen the slight dust of pink staining his cheeks. The man next to Dick gave him a pointed stare, as if sizing him up. Damian returned the stare and moved his gaze to the old man whose eyes twinkled – fucking twinkled – when Damian's blue eyes met his. Damian looked away and towards the ground, finding the surroundings annoying.

"Damian Wayne," Professor McGonagall loudly called and the room felt silent as Damian felt a smirk become to stretch over his lips.

Reaper: Well, how was that for a first chapter? D : I feel like I rushed things. If I did, sorry. I'll go back (in like a year or seven) and rewrite the chapter (I have a habit of doing that - waiting a few years before rewriting a chapter. I don't know why). Anyways, please share your thoughts - love it, hate it, wanna complain/vent/flame? Go ahead - just having you waste your time on me makes me happy. Have a good day/night/evening/morning (what)~!
